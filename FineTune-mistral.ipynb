Like everytime the resulting signal without blink is different in shape and amplitude, is that normal? Also, when I plot the original data (64 channels) vs the resulting data_noblink, each channel is not consistent regarding its positions (like data from channel 1 (Data(:,1)) is now in Data(:,6) and so on. My question is, is there a random effect of using ICA that I didn't catch when inverse PCA transform happens? if so, can I use a seed or similar to control this randomness? \\n[/INST]\\nGreat question. The ICA implementation here introduces randomness into the code. Quickly skimming the MATLAB doc, it's not immediately obvious how one can control it, but I have provided the link below for you reference. https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/rica.html#bvnjjp8-5 Hope that helps! -ShawGPT</s>\",\n",

T(m,n) is the coefficient corresponding to the basis wavelet with scale m and location n. Scale sets how \"stretched\" or \"squished\" the wavelet is, while the location sets where the wavelet is positioned. The first plot shown in the example, shown these coefficents for each choice of scale (e.g. 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, ...) and each choice of location i.e. time (x-axis).

Wavelet transform does a good job at capturing localized oscillations (like a blip or a chirp) in time series. FFT is great at getting global frequency information, meaning oscillations that persist over the whole signal. You can also \"chop up\" your EEG signals into epochs in which you perform an FFT, or even further, do sliding window over the entire signal and compute the FFT at each instance.

In the Gaussian example I would expect x to be wealth that increases from left to right and y to be the number of observations. Yet with that in mind, shouldn't the Pareto curve be such that x=w from low to high, with at the bottom a lot of observations and only very few at the high end of wealth? How is it that it typically explained that the 20% of the bottom end of the x-axis have 80% of everything? \\n[/INST]\\nGood question. Supposing wealth follows the given Pareto distribution, X could be net worth and P(X=x) is the probability that a random selection from the population will have net worth equal to x. The long tail here reflects the intuition that there are many more people with net worths around $100,000 than $100,000,000, since the as x increases P(X=x) decreases. The 80-20 rule comes in when you add up all the wealth of to the top 20%, you would get about 80% of the total wealth in the population.
